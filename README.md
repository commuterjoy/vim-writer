vim-text-editor
===============

I use vim for all types of writing, not just programming, so I keep a configuration that behaves like a nice text editor.

You can use it like this :-

```
/usr/local/bin/vim -c start -u ~/.textedit
```

# Files

 ./.textedit - The alternate .vimrc file, run as intructions above
 ./w.terminal - I've included my OSX 10.7 Terminal setting that I run from my dock.
 ./w.png - Icon you can associate with the terminal 

The configuration stores all files in _~/Notes_, so you'll need to create the directory.

# To Do

 - Command for previewing markdown as html
